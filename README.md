## ðŸš€ Quick Start
### 1. Environment Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MadeAgents/Quick-on-the-Uptake
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Quick-on-the-Uptake
   ```
3. MobileIAR dataset link: [Google Drive]()

   Please download the data and save it as Trajectories.

4. Model linkï¼šWarmed-up query rewriter [https://huggingface.co/wuuuuuz/IFRAgent](https://huggingface.co/wuuuuuz/IFRAgent)

(Steps 2 to 4 can be skipped as we have already prepared the personalized query and personalized SOP in the json file of the MobileIAR dataset.)

### 2. Get explicit intent flow and implicit intent flow
```bash
python get_intent_flow.py
```

### 3. Get explicit intent flow vector database
```bash
python get_rag.py
```

### 4. Get personalized query and personalized SOP 
```bash
python rewriting_loop.py
```

### 5. Obtain experimental results from the paper
```bash
python test_loop_{xxx}.py
```
Here, `xxx` refers to different baselines. If you set `test_func=test_loop_{xxx}`, you will get the experimental results of the baseline. If you set `test_func=test_loop_IFRAgent`, you will get the experimental results of `xxx` after being processed by IFRAgent.
